[2024-06-06 12:17:13 UTC] Martin_Gales: @ElysianDelacroix this try if strength gives more damage
[2024-06-06 12:17:41 UTC] coldz1ro: use run for 1more lvl up

[2024-06-06 12:18:08 UTC] NOOR_AK: but dex will give u some deff
[2024-06-06 12:18:14 UTC] large_johnson69: most of your damage comes from leveling ur weapons
[2024-06-06 12:18:14 UTC] gtw49: its fine that way
[2024-06-06 12:18:23 UTC] NOOR_AK: dex and hp go for it
[2024-06-06 12:18:29 UTC] salvo_mcboom: the scaling rises if you uprade the sword
[2024-06-06 12:18:30 UTC] ElysianDelacroix: Dex is for fast weapons mostly and strength for the big heavy ones
[2024-06-06 12:18:47 UTC] coldz1ro: for dmg upgrade weapon +6 and go @dorozea

[2024-06-06 12:20:22 UTC] ElysianDelacroix: I'd go to 40 vigor and then you can let it remain there until late game and skill all else
[2024-06-06 12:20:23 UTC] gtw49: you will only neeed 40 vigor to beat the game
[2024-06-06 12:20:26 UTC] NOOR_AK: 3hp 4 dex
[2024-06-06 12:20:36 UTC] gtw49: any more vigor will not the worth
[2024-06-06 12:20:59 UTC] Risc__V: HP is a bit dogshit unless you are trying to facetank the bosses. You just want some to have some room for error

[2024-06-06 12:22:02 UTC] salvo_mcboom: there are also other sources to incrase damage
[2024-06-06 12:22:06 UTC] Cuhhsin: the thing is, she can already take 2 hits from the boss, so more vigor wont solve the problem if she can get 1 more hit, the damage scales as well Xd
