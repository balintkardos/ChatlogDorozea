[2024-06-03 15:04:24 UTC] Martin_Gales: the bad part about ps4 controllers is that the game shows it as xbox
[2024-06-03 15:04:30 UTC] Martin_Gales: 39
[2024-06-03 15:04:41 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: because you played the game how you were supposed to omE

[2024-06-03 15:05:15 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: @HansoloSupremo why?
[2024-06-03 15:05:21 UTC] IRLKingsman: I prefer the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, it fits better in my hand
[2024-06-03 15:05:24 UTC] 1206paul_: ps5 controller is so good tho
[2024-06-03 15:05:26 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: all my Apex friends play on PS5 roller
[2024-06-03 15:05:41 UTC] HansoloSupremo: @IvanOnMyOwn i had to install third party software to play non steam games
[2024-06-03 15:05:56 UTC] HansoloSupremo: and use it only wired bc my pc's bluetooth sucks
[2024-06-03 15:06:00 UTC] Martin_Gales: imagine not using a wired xbox 360 controller GIGACHAD
[2024-06-03 15:06:08 UTC] Banties1g: Damily Flirt
[2024-06-03 15:06:11 UTC] 1206paul_: look up the unique features of the ps5 controller
[2024-06-03 15:06:14 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: @dorozea bro you have no idea, there are literally companies remaking that controller
[2024-06-03 15:06:16 UTC] utaBz: helloooo
[2024-06-03 15:06:22 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: and people buy that stuff, custom made controllers
[2024-06-03 15:06:24 UTC] Aluminiumminimumimmunity: Microsoft hates it when you don't use an Xbox controller
[2024-06-03 15:06:29 UTC] Martin_Gales: ps5 controller always look so weird to me
[2024-06-03 15:06:34 UTC] Zeololz: bro using bing AINTNOWAY
[2024-06-03 15:06:42 UTC] HansoloSupremo: i know its good but the trigger features only work in ps5 games
[2024-06-03 15:06:50 UTC] tooezrightnow: ps controller better than xbox tho
[2024-06-03 15:06:55 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: just think about all the CoD and Apex pros for example
[2024-06-03 15:07:01 UTC] utaBz: if u need a controller ps 2 controllers are the best
[2024-06-03 15:07:01 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: they all use custom PS5 controllers
[2024-06-03 15:07:03 UTC] Martin_Gales: ps3 is a classic design
[2024-06-03 15:07:09 UTC] Martin_Gales: basically a ps2 controller
[2024-06-03 15:07:10 UTC] Zeololz: ahhh i like this one
[2024-06-03 15:07:11 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: this is a classic
[2024-06-03 15:07:19 UTC] Martin_Gales: peak controller
[2024-06-03 15:07:22 UTC] Banties1g: ps2 controller
[2024-06-03 15:07:24 UTC] xXGenly_Top_AwpXx: the 360 is the dominant controller i feel like most would agree
[2024-06-03 15:07:32 UTC] frostykantus: Try get all achievement on Elden ring I try and change my life to hell
[2024-06-03 15:07:36 UTC] IRLKingsman: I still remember the controllers from the Nintendo 64, which were a pain compared to what is available today
[2024-06-03 15:07:43 UTC] Martin_Gales: the ps5 controller looks straight out of warframe
[2024-06-03 15:07:43 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: its fine
[2024-06-03 15:07:44 UTC] Fizzle_7: tigger feedback
[2024-06-03 15:07:46 UTC] 1206paul_: ergonomics

[2024-06-03 15:08:06 UTC] sanzzes: ps5 controller is alittle bit bigger for bigger hands. ps4 controllers are to liittle for some hands ^^

[2024-06-03 15:18:24 UTC] IRLKingsman: I think you should first play through Elden Ring and then watch the trailer, it doesn't help to understand everything about the story completely, but at least a little
[2024-06-03 15:18:36 UTC] Martin_Gales: basically they said use a blunt weapons such as Hammers and Maces
