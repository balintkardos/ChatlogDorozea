 he word “Andy” on Twitch is used to refer to anyone as anything, really. For example, “React Andy” for streamers who do a lot of reaction-based content, or “5k Andy” for a streamer that has 5 thousand viewers. “Andy” comes from a friend of former Twitch streamer Ice Poseidon, whose name was Mexican Andy.
