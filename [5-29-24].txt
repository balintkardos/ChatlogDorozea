[2024-05-29 18:52:48 UTC] Banties1g: Constantly half-attentive/reading chat instead of reacting, eating what seemed to be an entire banquet of food (each bite means not watching blink-and-you-miss-it moments), always angrily confused from missing said moments, and next to no reaction to genuinely emotional parts of the cinematics. Definitely needs to improve a lot before watching anything else honestly.
