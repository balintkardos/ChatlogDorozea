[2024-05-09 17:53:14 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: You do not want to counter Zarya one-on-one as a Winston, instead, focus on baiting out her bubbles and tickling Zarya and her teammates with Winston’s Tesla Cannon. Acting as a threat will peel away Zarya’s attention and strip her of her cooldowns, leaving squishy DPS and support teammates vulnerable.
