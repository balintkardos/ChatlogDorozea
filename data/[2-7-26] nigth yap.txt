[2026-02-07 06:37:38 UTC] Swimtowin1: how can that be true
[2026-02-07 06:37:39 UTC] HoneyKick: Research confirms that dairy milk is more hydrating than plain water over a longer period because its natural components—protein, fat, and lactose (sugar)—slow stomach emptying. Sodium in milk acts like a sponge, helping the body retain fluids rather than producing urine quickly. Milk outperforms water and sports drinks in long-term rehydration, especially after exercise.
