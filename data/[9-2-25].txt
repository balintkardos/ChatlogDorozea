[2025-09-02 15:34:36 UTC] BertVanBeterbed: @slavdope He is a bit of a lane bully, but not as strong as others (like darius). He is a strong splitpusher, but cant defend against groups of people. In lane, he struggles against high mobilty, because if he cant E or Cage you his damage is non existent. Also what he lacks is reliable CC.  TL;DR Against the right matchup, he is op. Against a bad one, he suffers
