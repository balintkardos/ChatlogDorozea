[2024-09-07 18:00:45 UTC] 5k0rn: parable: Doro had been fixated on trying vanilla-flavored gum for two months. Each day, she resolved to visit the supermarket, yet somehow, she never did. Perhaps it was a fear of change or the comfort of routine that kept her from venturing out. The vanilla-flavored gum remained a distant fantasy, always just out of reach. And so, her simple desire lingered, unfulfilled and quietly unresolved.
