[2025-11-21 17:54:31 UTC] TheShadeMan: @rafa30___ I believe this game will survive more then Tarkov, because it's casual friendly. In Tarkov you spend most of the time in stash and then end up dead in a game after 5 minutes u got in, then waste another tremendouse amount of time in stash, getting frustrated and etc. Here is more casual. Plus the game has amazing lore, gameplay, sound and overall it's fun to play it, not boring Tarkov

That's the idea of it, to die, respawn, go back to loot, die again and repeat that circle. It's the way you play it that is captivating you. For me, I played already 100+ hours and still having fun, even dying and loosing all the shit I have, cuz it's not so punishing. Idk, just my opinion bro

You don't feel tired playing it, you don't get your ass and chair burned after loosing few lobbies and you have real fun and fast matches. I think it's enough to keep the game alive + constant updates, new maps will refresh it everytime it get's a bit boring.
