[2024-05-28 15:29:19 UTC] oJov: intelligence is for mage builds
[2024-05-28 15:29:21 UTC] poopkhan: upgrade vigor and decterity
[2024-05-28 15:29:21 UTC] oJov: (cringe)
[2024-05-28 15:29:21 UTC] psx_lucy: wtflip
[2024-05-28 15:29:23 UTC] Martin_Gales: one of the wisest people alive mhm
[2024-05-28 15:29:26 UTC] poopkhan: vigor is hp
[2024-05-28 15:29:27 UTC] LX212: no
[2024-05-28 15:29:29 UTC] peroni_nasturo_azuro: if you were smart you wouldnt have gotten stuck on an optional boss for 7 hours man
[2024-05-28 15:29:31 UTC] Ravenbtw: you are very smart mhm (paypal in dms)
[2024-05-28 15:29:35 UTC] oJov: okay so what kind of weapon do u want to use doro?
[2024-05-28 15:29:35 UTC] ベータ: before you level think of what weapon you want to use
[2024-05-28 15:29:36 UTC] MoodyJ1: endurance is stamina
[2024-05-28 15:29:38 UTC] macbless: Dexterity is a kind of power
[2024-05-28 15:29:41 UTC] oJov: u 100% will need vigor
[2024-05-28 15:29:44 UTC] LX212: endurance is stamina. you can see what stats are improved on the left
[2024-05-28 15:29:45 UTC] strobey_: dex also increases damage
[2024-05-28 15:29:55 UTC] strobey_: health
[2024-05-28 15:29:57 UTC] oJov: dexterity is power for light weapons, strenght is power for heavy weapons
[2024-05-28 15:30:01 UTC] poopkhan: dex is damage
[2024-05-28 15:30:03 UTC] oJov: FP is for mage builds
[2024-05-28 15:30:03 UTC] LX212: fp is mana

[2024-05-28 15:30:18 UTC] Martin_Gales: is it faith points?
[2024-05-28 15:30:18 UTC] oJov: vigor = hp
[2024-05-28 15:30:27 UTC] LX212: if you want to do a samurai build you want to go dexterity but at this point you need more hp
[2024-05-28 15:30:28 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: who is vigor
[2024-05-28 15:30:29 UTC] oJov: basically get some vigor and 1 of the power skills
[2024-05-28 15:30:30 UTC] peroni_nasturo_azuro: but the samurai lost
[2024-05-28 15:30:34 UTC] strobey_: top left
[2024-05-28 15:30:35 UTC] peroni_nasturo_azuro: why would you want to be a loser
[2024-05-28 15:30:37 UTC] macbless: If you wanna keep playing as samurai go for more hp and dex
[2024-05-28 15:30:37 UTC] xMoz72: top left
[2024-05-28 15:30:37 UTC] oJov: topleft

[2024-05-28 15:30:47 UTC] Banties1g: top left busta
[2024-05-28 15:30:47 UTC] ベータ: arcane is good for status effects and drop chance

[2024-05-28 15:31:25 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: you can lvl w/e u want
[2024-05-28 15:31:26 UTC] k2u5as: that's starting class only
[2024-05-28 15:31:29 UTC] oJov: yeah HP is the safe bet
[2024-05-28 15:31:32 UTC] Martin_Gales: samurai is just a base
[2024-05-28 15:31:34 UTC] k2u5as: doesn't matter latter
[2024-05-28 15:31:40 UTC] Martin_Gales: you can be whatever you want
[2024-05-28 15:31:41 UTC] macbless: You can level up more
[2024-05-28 15:31:43 UTC] LX212: the only point for the starter classes are that you get certain stats faster but technically you can do any build with any starter
[2024-05-28 15:31:44 UTC] oJov: for mage also
[2024-05-28 15:31:47 UTC] oJov: and for bleed
[2024-05-28 15:31:52 UTC] IRLKingsman: You can develop in the direction you like
[2024-05-28 15:31:59 UTC] oJov: mage
[2024-05-28 15:32:01 UTC] macbless: Arcane is blood damage
[2024-05-28 15:32:02 UTC] LX212: faith is holy damage
[2024-05-28 15:32:02 UTC] oJov: intelligence = mage too
[2024-05-28 15:32:07 UTC] k2u5as: you can look stats on what it increase
[2024-05-28 15:32:09 UTC] Typhu25: doros mind stat is already maxed out with that wham cranium

[2024-05-28 15:32:20 UTC] enseje: xd
[2024-05-28 15:32:20 UTC] oJov: mind is also gonna be useless for u
[2024-05-28 15:32:21 UTC] LX212: your spells do more damage the her intelligence you have
[2024-05-28 15:32:23 UTC] macbless: Intelligence is magic
[2024-05-28 15:32:27 UTC] LX212: higher*
[2024-05-28 15:32:31 UTC] oJov: the rest are good

[2024-05-28 15:32:45 UTC] oJov: ask urself what kind of weapon u want to use
[2024-05-28 15:32:47 UTC] strobey_: dex is more important
[2024-05-28 15:32:49 UTC] oJov: heavier or lighter weapons?
[2024-05-28 15:32:53 UTC] LX212: it really depends on what weapons you want to play
[2024-05-28 15:33:01 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: ICANT my streamer
[2024-05-28 15:33:09 UTC] Typhu25: dawg
[2024-05-28 15:33:11 UTC] Banties1g: have a guess
[2024-05-28 15:33:11 UTC] k2u5as: heavy weapon slow but more damage
[2024-05-28 15:33:11 UTC] Martin_Gales: slow heavy more damage
[2024-05-28 15:33:12 UTC] oJov: yes, but it attacks slower so u play less agressive
[2024-05-28 15:33:12 UTC] Typhu25: what do you think
[2024-05-28 15:33:20 UTC] xXGenly_Top_AwpXx: did she kill the homie on the horse or naw
[2024-05-28 15:33:21 UTC] LX212: heavy weapons are slow and high damage but light weapons are fast but a bit less damage
[2024-05-28 15:33:24 UTC] LX212: its both good
[2024-05-28 15:33:24 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: you gonna have to figure it out HEHE

[2024-05-28 15:33:49 UTC] shekyttv: do you want to attach quick and move aroud or just bonk for big dmg
[2024-05-28 15:33:54 UTC] oJov: katana counts as a light weapon

[2024-05-28 15:34:32 UTC] oJov: katana is VERY good for first playthrough
[2024-05-28 15:34:36 UTC] Martin_Gales: for now it should be fine mhm
[2024-05-28 15:34:37 UTC] LX212: honestly maybe just level up hp and stamina until you find a weapon you want to play and then you can start leveling those stats
[2024-05-28 15:34:47 UTC] oJov: but u choose whatever weapon u want to use
[2024-05-28 15:34:54 UTC] oJov: ur gonna find loads of weapons
[2024-05-28 15:34:55 UTC] macbless: There are other katanas also, there is a cool dragón katana with lightning damage later on
[2024-05-28 15:34:59 UTC] xXGenly_Top_AwpXx: i thought you were getting pretty close with the katana just gotta master his attacks
[2024-05-28 15:34:59 UTC] zzwwzzwwzzwwzz: doro just go beat the next boss

[2024-05-28 15:35:12 UTC] k2u5as: you use stamina when attack and run
[2024-05-28 15:35:13 UTC] LX212: you see the highlighted stats on the left? thats whats going up
[2024-05-28 15:35:15 UTC] strobey_: you can re-do the attributes later anyways
