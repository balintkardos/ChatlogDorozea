[2024-06-24 17:12:33 UTC] cryyyyys: I did find Rellana harder than Mesmer, the problem with these bosses is how agressive they are, no time for healing
[2024-06-24 17:12:38 UTC] RealDrLing: But this game does not take place on earth, it takes place on a plane with no magnetic field because it would be too op for all bosses not to wear armor vs Doro

[2024-06-24 17:47:57 UTC] peroni_nasturo_azuro: Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that occur through a magnetic field, which allows objects to attract or repel each other. Because both electric currents and magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, magnetism is one of two aspects of electromagnetism.  The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves.
