## Data Description
The dataset was sourced from public Twitch and includes chat messges date and the sender's data from 2024-05-01 to 2024-08-31. It contains more than 300k records with columns such as Date, User, Message, and StreamID. The data was cleaned to remove duplicates and missing values. If stream crashed and 2 separated vod was, it is merged together.

## Methodology
The analysis was performed using Python, with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, WordCloud and ImageColorGenerator for creating cool imagies, and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.

## Results
//TODO

## Conclusion
//TODO

## Usage
You can use it with this:

```python
# Read the list of filenames from the configuration file
with open('file_list.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as config_file:
    file_names = config_file.read().splitlines()

# Regex pattern to match the data format
pattern = r'\[(.*?)\] (.*?): (.*)'

# Initialize an empty list to store parsed data
datalist = []
stream_count = 0

# Iterate over each specified file
for file in file_names:
    full_path = "data\\" + file
    with open(full_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            match = re.match(pattern, line)
            if match:
                date, user, message = match.groups()
                datalist.append([date, user, message, stream_count])
    stream_count += 1
```
