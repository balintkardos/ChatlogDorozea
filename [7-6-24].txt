[2024-07-06 14:19:38 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: Stat Allocation Vigor (VIG): 55-60 Ensures you have enough health to survive in both PvE and PvP. Mind (MND): 15-20 Provides enough FP for weapon skills and occasional spell usage. Endurance (END): 30-35 Increases stamina for attacks and dodging, and equips load to wear heavier armor. Strength (STR): 20-25 Needed to meet the minimum requirement for Hand of Malenia. Dexterity (DEX): 80-90 Primary scaling stat for both Rivers of Blood and Hand of Malenia. Intelligence (INT): Base (keep at the star
[2024-07-06 14:19:43 UTC] IvanOnMyOwn: Faith (FTH): Base (keep at the starting level for your class) Not needed for this build. Arcane (ARC): 45-50 Boosts bleed buildup and some bleed-based incantations.
