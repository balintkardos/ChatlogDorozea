[2024-08-21 16:15:20 UTC] riesenklotz: To make it clear: Hook the fish by holding the right trigger when you feel a strong bite, wait for the fish to stop struggling. Spin the right analog clockwise to reel the fish. Point the left analog stick down for 3 seconds while continuously reeling with the right analog stick. Wait 3 seconds to repeat. If the fish starts to struggle again let go of both analog sticks and wait for the fish to stop struggling. Rinse and repeat.
