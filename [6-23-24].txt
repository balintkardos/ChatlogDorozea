[2024-06-23 17:33:46 UTC] RealDrLing: During the clone phase, when Lamenter unsummons the clones at the end of each phase, you will gain a stack of a debuff for every clone that was still alive at the end of the phase. The number of stacks you have is displayed as a ring around your character. If the number of stacks reaches 6 (7?) during the fight, you instantly die.

[2024-06-23 18:16:05 UTC] dl_ojutai: It feels like you straight up can't do enough damage to these bosses just one-handing  a weapon tbh.

[2024-06-23 18:25:58 UTC] c4rth: Our progress is often concealed by lack of measurable results and time working in tandem. Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
[2024-06-23 18:26:03 UTC] dl_ojutai: Real talk, not trying to tell you what to do, but when I finally got her, I just jump attacked her over and over again. A lot of her attacks missed.

[2024-06-23 18:30:06 UTC] dl_ojutai: Yeah idk, I had dual reapers so my attack was a little quicker? She has horizontal attacks that miss a lot, but sometimes she does those vertical slashes a bunch and then it doesn't work lol.
