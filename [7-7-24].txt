[2024-07-07 13:42:02 UTC] klimzaa: The O Mother emote is located just north of Bonny Village in Scadu Altus. But, don't get too excited just yet, because to get anywhere close to this location, you need to do some hardcore parkour to progress down a giant hole. Make your way to the Moorth Ruins Cross Site of Grace and ride east towards Moorth Ruins until you see a massive hole (you can't miss it).

[2024-07-07 16:43:32 UTC] klimzaa: @ErPardi In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the Biot–Savart law (⫽ˈbiːoʊ səˈvɑːr⫽ or ⫽ˈbjoʊ səˈvɑːr⫽)[1] is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. The Biot–Savart law is fundamental to magnetostatics. It is valid in the magnetostatic approximation and consistent with both Ampère's circuital law and Gauss's law for magnetism.[2] When magnet

[2024-07-07 16:54:14 UTC] ShovelyJoe91: uuh that attack bro
[2024-07-07 16:54:18 UTC] klimzaa: @Martin_Gales because they switched to a build that does 6k damage per second against him thats why
[2024-07-07 16:54:30 UTC] klimzaa: if u have to switch builds for a boss to make it easier then obviously that boss is harder mhm
[2024-07-07 16:54:30 UTC] iFz4G: nah radhan is the hardest
